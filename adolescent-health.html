          <h4>NUTRITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR YOUNG ADULTS</h4>
          <div class="underline"></div>
          <p>Adolescence is a complex period of rapid growth and development accompanied by changing bodies and minds. Proper nutrition is critical during this time in order to provide a foundation for strength both cognitively and physically. Specific concerns such as maximizing bone density, enhancing athletic endurance and performance, and achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight are often priorities to address within the context of a healthy balanced diet. Endocrine conditions such as Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), thyroid abnormalities, and menstrual irregularities often require attention during these teenage years as well. Above all else, instilling a healthy relationship with food—one that is characterized by balanced, inclusive eating and the development of a healthy body image is paramount during the adolescent years.</p>

    <h3>ESTABLISHING HEALTHY PATTERNS FOR LIFE</h3>

  <div class="text">
    <p>Adolescence can be a very challenging time with so many changes to manage for both parents and teens. It’s paramount for teens and young adults to feel understood, especially when it comes to their changing and developing bodies and minds. They are often misinformed about Nutrition and dependent on information that has been distorted from unreliable internet and social media sources and contexts. The impact of such information can lead to unhealthy eating choices as well as destructive thoughts and behaviors. Thankfully, adolescents are typically eager to learn and they crave the information, support and skills that will clear up confusion about how, what and when to eat so that they may feel their strongest and best. Our adolescent specialists adore this age group.  We speak their specific language and we cater to their particular needs. And, no matter the explicit goals, in every conversation, our adolescent specialists pay exceptionally careful attention to the language used to discuss food, weight, shape and size with the intention of guiding teens to develop into strong, autonomous eaters.resolving picky eating, and creating a foundation for health in the years to come.</p>
